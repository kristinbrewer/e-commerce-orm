# E-Commerce Back End with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
User will use command-line application to interface with a database management system that allows e-commerce companies to view and manage information related to products, their categories and tag systems. 

## Description
This command-line application allows users to dynamically navigate informational datbases. User will use MySQL to initiate and run databases created with Sequelize. Databases are then seeded before running server with Node. Given use of api routes, user will be able to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE APIs to successfully create, update, and delete data in database. The Insomnia application is used to test API functions.
